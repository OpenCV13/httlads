Preface
=======

It is said that the most important characteristic of a data scientist is curiosity.  Curiosity has certainly led me on a path of discovery throughout the world of data science and many fascinating data sets that I  have encountered.  So, the premise of this book is to let the data sets lead you to learning.  The best and most interesting way to learn is to find some data and then begin to ask questions about it an analyze it, visualize it, and then write down new questions that have occurred to you as you have been doing your initial analysis.

This is how I organized the first two data science courses I ever taught, and surprisingly it worked.  In fact it worked so well that I would never want to teach it any other way.  Nevertheless it may not be clear from a high level look at the table of contents what this course covers and the learning goals it strives to achieve.  So let me lay it out for you in a different organization.
