A farmer wants to customize his fertilizer for his current crop.  He can buy plant food mix A and plant food mix B.  Each cubic yard of food A contains 20 pounds of phosphoric acid, 30 pounds of nitrogen and 5 pounds of potash.

He requires a minimum of 460 pounds of phosphoric acid, 9060 pounds of nitrogen and 220 pounds of potash.  If food A costs $30 per cubic yard and food B costs $35 per cubic yard, how many cubic yards of each food should the farmer blend to meet the minimum chemical requirements at a minimal cost?  What is this cost?
